This was the first project I created after learning how to code. At the time, I wasn’t working professionally yet and wanted to test and showcase my skills.

The application is designed to function as both a Point of Sale (POS) system and inventory management software tailored for small retailers.

While I no longer maintain this project, I keep it here as a reminder of where I started and how far I’ve come in my journey.
